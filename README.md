Determine the number of unique values in each column 
For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value (4 points)
Create a new value called Other that contains rare categorical variables 
Create a feature array, X, and a target array, y by using the preprocessed data 
Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets 
Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data
