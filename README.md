The data used was:

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application

Preprocess the Data 

Create a dataframe containing the charity_data.csv data , and identify the target and feature variables in the dataset 
Drop the EIN and NAME columns 
Determine the number of unique values in each column 
For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value (4 points)
Create a new value called Other that contains rare categorical variables 
Create a feature array, X, and a target array, y by using the preprocessed data 
Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets 
Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data
